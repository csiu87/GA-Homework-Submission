The definition of a login is that a user logged in with their username and an exit is when the user logged off or exited browser. Potential system issues at Hooli could cause missing login information or inaccurate session exit time.\n",

For example, how is profession categorized, what specific location fields are filled out and does this need to be cleaned up, what does activity score actually represent? Can we break this metric out further to get more meaningful data on adoption and usage such as the type of activity and when it occurs. At what time during the day/week is activity increasing or decreasing. \n",

Create some simple frequency charts categorizing by each variabe to understand distribution, ie male vs female, profession, age, days since last login, etc. Use this to pinpoint any problem areas such as outliers and and missing data. Determine whether the outliers should be included and how the missing data should be dealt with. Take note of the distribution.\n",
